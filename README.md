### Question 1
*  Create a generic class named “Repository” and it 
should have 2 generic parameters TID and TEntity. It should also implement an interface “IRepository” which takes same generic parameters. TEntity should be always a class and it must have an empty constructor. This condition needs to be enforced, so that anything that doesn’t meet this condition can’t be set as TEntity. No method or property is needed for the class.

### Question 2
* Create an extension method for string that when called, converts the string to Pascal case. (i.e. In Pascal case, the first letter of each word is in upper case and rest is in lowercase and no space is present., for example: BirthDate, FullName etc.). You must implement the body of this method. So you need to provide an working extension method that really works.

### Question 3
* Create a static method (name: DoSomething)  in a static class (name: TestClass), that returns 3 values using value tupple. The values are, string name, int age, double weight. Method body is not needed. Use, not implemented exception.

### Question 4

* Write a linq query to find all numbers greater than 50, from a List<int>.

### Question 5

* Write a foreach loop to iterate over a dictionary and print all it’s items. You use any data type for dictionary types. You can name the method or class anything you like.

### Question 6
 
* Write a console application to generate fibonacci numbers using a recursive function. User will input a number “N” and the code will print the Nth fibonacci number. But it has to be done using recursion. The value of N will be less than 15.
